    text: Looking at the unavailability of beds during this pandemic, our insurance partner HDFC Ergo has agreed to cover Domiciliary Hospitalization for the month of May. Employees can cover cost of treatment availed at home for Covid19 positive cases for maximum up to 14 days per incident, which in the normal course would have required care and treatment at a hospital but is actually taken while confined at home due to non-availability of the beds in the hospitals. The diagnosis of Covid19 should be confirmed from a government authorized diagnostic center and the patient should be on active line of treatment which would have warranted hospitalization stay. Please note that this would not cover cost of medical equipment purchased such as ventilators, oxygen cylinders or concentrators, etc. Please reach out to Kartik Yedari for any claims (Kartik.Yederi@philips.com | +91 9663368821)
